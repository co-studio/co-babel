## Getting Started
In ```development```, traffic from the subscribed FB page will be tunneled to
localhost via [```localtunnel```](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).
*The FB page webhook url must be changed to accomodate the localtunnel url.*

In ```production```, remember to change the webhook url from the localtunnel url.

## Bot testing
old webhook url: ```bot-test.impressiv.io/webhook```
